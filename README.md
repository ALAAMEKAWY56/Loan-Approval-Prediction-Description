# üí≥ Loan Approval Prediction

## üìå Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant information such as income, employment, and credit history.  
The dataset is **imbalanced**, so we applied **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to improve model performance.  

Two models ‚Äî **Logistic Regression** (baseline) and **Decision Tree Classifier** (tuned) ‚Äî were built and evaluated.

## üöÄ Key Highlights
- **Goal:** Predict loan approval status (binary classification).  
- **Dataset:** Loan Approval Prediction Dataset (Kaggle).  
- **Class Imbalance:** Addressed using SMOTE.  
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.  
- **Visualization:**  
  - Class distribution **before and after SMOTE**.  
  - Feature distributions and correlation heatmaps.

## üìä Performance Results

| **Metric**   | **Logistic Regression** | **Decision Tree** |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| Accuracy     | 0.7845                  | 0.9707             |
| Precision    | 0.7233                  | 0.9592             |
| Recall       | 0.6824                  | 0.9623             |
| F1 Score     | 0.7023                  | 0.9608             |

The **Decision Tree Classifier** significantly outperformed Logistic Regression, achieving nearly **97% accuracy** and balanced precision-recall scores.

## üìà Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Missing value imputation.  
   - Encoding categorical features.  
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):**  
   - Visualized class imbalance and feature distributions.  
3. **Class Imbalance Handling:**  
   - Applied SMOTE and visualized **before vs. after** distributions.  
4. **Model Training:**  
   - Logistic Regression (baseline).  
   - Decision Tree (optimized with hyperparameters).  
5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   - Compared metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1).  
   - Confusion matrix analysis.
